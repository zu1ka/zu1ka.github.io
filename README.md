# Zoulkarnein Bagagnan Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio! This is a responsive, modern frontend portfolio showcasing my skills, projects, and contact information. Built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, it features smooth animations, a sidebar navigation, and an easy way to connect with me.

--- This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/12ro0DLPOCp9MCfvN543IL9Jq8n9H_d--671V2wDrgGY/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I used AI on this project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on desktop and mobile.
- **Sidebar Navigation**: Slide-in menu for smaller screens.
- **Projects Showcase**: Display of my key projects with tech tags.
- **About Me Section**: Skills, tech stack, and personal bio.
- **Contact Form**: Integrated with Formspree for easy messaging.
- **Smooth Animations**: Slide-in, fade-up effects for a polished look.

## Technical Concept Gained: CSS Animations

One technical concept I gained greater mastery over in this project is **CSS animations**, specifically using `@keyframes` and transitions. My mental model of keyframes is similar to JavaScript functions: you define an animation once, give it a name, and reuse it by applying it to different elements with rules like duration and timing. I used animations across my project cards, contact section, navigation links, and sidebar menu to create smoother interactions and a more polished user experience.

## Challenging Requirement: Responsive Header & Sidebar

A requirement I found challenging was implementing a responsive header with a hamburger menu and sidebar navigation. At a certain breakpoint, I hid the main navigation using media queries and displayed a hamburger icon instead. When clicked, a JavaScript event listener toggles the sidebar, which appears above the rest of the content using a higher `z-index`. Adding animations to the sidebar created a smooth slide-in effect and improved usability.

## How I Used AI

I used AI to better understand CSS animations, debug layout and interaction issues, and clarify concepts when I got stuck. AI helped guide my problem-solving while allowing me to fully understand and write my own code.
